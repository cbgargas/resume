intro	"I am a passionate scientist and Ph.D. candidate independently conducting research on algaeâ€”bacteria interactions. I have experience as a field, wet lab, and computational biologist. My field experiences include routine periphyton, phytoplankton, and macroinvertebrate sampling. My experience in the wet lab includes sample processing, chlorophyll and ATP analyses, molecular biology techniques, and the isolation, maintenance, and preservation of algal cultures. Lastly, my experience as a computational biologist has resulted in me being skilled with Linux, command line interfaces, phylogenetic and genomic analyses. I am highly skilled in data wrangling, data analysis and visualization in BASH and the R programming language. I am an advocate for preserving and exploring biological diversity."
