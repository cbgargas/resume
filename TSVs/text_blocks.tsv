intro	"As a biologist, I am a passionate scientist responsible for independently conducting research. I have previous experience as a field and wet lab biologist, and my PhD involving computational biology. My experience as a computational biologist has resulted in me being skilled with Linux, command line interfaces, phylogenetics, microbiome analysis, and genomic analyses. I am highly skilled in data wrangling and statistical data analysis using BASH and the R programming language. I am highly skilled in data visualization using R and Adobe products. I've executed data workflows using R, BASH, and SLURM. I've executed end-to-end reports and visualizations using Markdown and Quarto. I also have some experience with Python and Shiny web app development. For the rest of my career I am focused on pursuing my love of data analysis, management, and visualization, as well as implementing analytical workflows."
